<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    I'm Antonio De Lucreziis, currently studying maths (see later). I'm interested in computer science, maths,
    programming, programming languages and recently also in system administration.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes I build things out of paper using some origami techniques. But, if I had the tools, I would probably make
    them out of real materials.
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence, I'm also interested in all things loosely related to engineering and robotics. I own a Raspberry Pi but it only got me in touch with Linux and some system administration as I used to host my website on it with ngnix.

<p>
    A few years ago I often made some generative art every so ofter and it be found on my Instagram (link below).

<h2>School</h2>

<p>
    I went to high school in Taranto at Liceo Scientifico Battaglini.
</p>

<p>
    For now, I'm taking a degree in Mathematics at the University of Pisa. After that I will attend the two remaining
    years
    to get a master (Magistrale) still in Mathematics...
